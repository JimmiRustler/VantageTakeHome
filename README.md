# VantageTakeHome
Takehome project for Vantage

Update 2: So, I went ahead and made .bat files for installing the program locally on windows. Unsure how to write those for mac on windows.
Simply clone the repo and double click install.bat inside the VantageTakeHome folder. This will install the python virtual envrionment and it's packages
as well as the frontends npm requirements. Once it finishes, start.bat can be run and it should load the app. Hopefuill it all works!
