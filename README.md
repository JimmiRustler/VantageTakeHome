# VantageTakeHome
Takehome project for Vantage

Hello!

Sorry it took so long to get a repo to you. I wanted something tangible in here that wasn't just tutorial code. So far the frontend is built. Learned a ton about css and html on that as well as all the neat things react can do. There is a backend for a different application I made from a tutorial but is not my code. I am currently messing with it and figuring out how to marray the two effectively. This has tasken far longer than I thought but have thoroughly enjoyed the work!
