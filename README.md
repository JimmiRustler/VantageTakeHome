# VantageTakeHome
Takehome project for Vantage

Hello!

Sorry it took so long to get a repo to you. I wanted something tangible in here that wasn't just tutorial code. So far the frontend is built. Learned a ton about css and html on that as well as all the neat things react can do. There is a backend for a different application I made from a tutorial but is not my code. I am currently messing with it and figuring out how to marray the two effectively. This has tasken far longer than I thought but have thoroughly enjoyed the work!


Update: I've finally gotten a working product. The backend can be saved to as well as loaded from when the app first loads. Text and ad images change in real time. I need to format the ad to align more like the facebook ad shown in the project specs as well as tidy some variables and headers but then this should be ready to work as my submission. This took far longer than I expeted but I have sure enjoyed learning all this!
